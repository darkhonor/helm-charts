# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for the [darkhonor Helm charts](https://github.com/darkhonor/helm-charts) project.

## Getting started

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts in this repository.

Refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

## Installation

```sh
helm repo add darkhonor http://darkhonor.github.io/helm-charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo darkhonor` to search the charts.

## Credits and Acknowledgements

I would like to credit [James Wynn](https://github.com/jameswynn) for helping
me figure out how to structure this project. This is my first attempt at
creating a public Helm Chart repository. Please check out his site for the
charts he's hosting within his [Helm Repository](https://github.com/jameswynn/helm-charts/tree/main).
